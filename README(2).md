# NeXT Assessment(2)

## Description
This is an assessment that I made prior to the interview for one of the graduate programme. The code is about locating the International Space Satellite(ISS) by using Application Programming Interface(API). The API that is used in this project will help us by providing the location of ISS in the earths's orbit. For this second sheet to answer the question, the language that I used is JavaScript with the implementation of AJAX script to connect with the API server and to perform the callback. For the API, I am going to use: https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/satellites/25544/positions and https://api.wheretheiss.at/v1/coordinates/
