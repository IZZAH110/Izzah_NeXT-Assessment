# Izzah_NeXT-Assessment 2022

Description
This is an assessment that I made prior to the interview for one of the graduate programme.
The code is about locating the International Space Satellite(ISS) by using Application Programming Interface(API). The API that is used in this project will help us by providing the location of ISS in the earths's orbit. The language that I used is Phyton and using Jupyter-Notebook open-source application as code editor. For the API, I am going to use the API from link: http://api.open-notify.org/iss-now.json.

The first step, I load the required libraries in the jupyter notebook. Those are pandas and plotly. Pandas is use to create the data frame and plotly to plot the location of ISS on the map.

I am using Extension B: Returning the information as an API call (Back End). The url will be converted into the JSON format by using pandas library which is read_json() method. The information that will be provided is the location of ISS for current time.
